# Hyperion (WIP) 
![Hyperion Icon](/images/iconLowRes.png) 

## 📣 Welcome to Hyperion, the browser I created using Java and Swift with the JCEF library!

💡 Hyperion is a fully functional web browser that is able to browse the internet, open and close tabs, and perform basic browsing functions such as back and forward navigation. It also includes additional features such as a bookmark manager and a history tracker for an even more convenient browsing experience.

## 🚀 To get started with Hyperion, you can...

### 1. Use the source code

clone the repository using the following command:

 ``` git clone https://github.com/parcivalltd/Hyperion.git ```

🧑‍💼 In order to execute the Maven project, make sure you have Maven installed on your system. 

``` git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/Hyperion.git ```
To install Maven, follow these steps:

🧑‍💼 In order to execute the Maven project, make sure you have Maven installed on your system. Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
Download Maven from the [official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and unzip the file to a directory of your choice.
Add the Maven bin directory to your system PATH variable. This allows you to run Maven from any directory.

- Right-click on the Start button and click on "System".
- Click on "Advanced system settings" on the left-hand side.
- Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
- Under "System variables", scroll down and find the "Path" variable. Click on "Edit".
- Click on "New" and add the path to the Maven bin directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\Apache Maven\bin).
- Click "OK" to save the changes.

Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```mvn clean install```

💻 Please note that the **JCEF library**, which is necessary for Hyperion to run, is quite large (over 200 MB). For this reason, I have uploaded the JCEF bundle folder to the following link: https://brgrohrbach-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/julian_gabriel_brgrohrbach_ac_at/Er24cPZmv3ZHoAcN-H7mVvYBzbT7bgdeGBvPk04C1JY6Ew?e=QtJJ1Y.

### 2. Use the release

Download the setup in the releases section of this repository:

Click on releases -> download the latest stable release.
To execute the Browser download the .jar file and the dependencies. Extract the dependencies into the same directory as the .jar file and open the .jar file. Now its downloading the libraries, so: be patient. When it finished downloading, the browser will open.

### 🙏Thank you for visiting and I hope you enjoy using Hyperion! 🙏
